    <summary>#2 - STEAM MARINATED CHICKEN WITH PEPPERCORN - 花椒醃雞
    </summary>
    This is a spin-off of the more famous traditional dish Nanjing salted duck鹽水鴨.  This recipe uses chicken, which is more readily available, and a simpler cooking method. Nonetheless, the finished product is just as delicious as its famous cousin.

    <h2>INGREDIENT:</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 whole chicken (approx. 3 lb.)</li>
      <li>2 TBSP salt</li>
      <li>1 TBSP Sichuan peppercorn</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Toast salt and Sichuan peppercorn in a frying pan with low heat. Move the frying pan in circular motion constantly until the smell of the peppercorn comes out.</li>
      <li>Rub peppercorn salt mixture on the surface and inside of the chicken. Cover and marinate for 1-3 day in the refrigerator. (the longer it marinade, the saltier it becomes) </li>
      <li>Before steaming, remove the peppercorn from the surface of the chicken and put it in a deep dish.</li>
      <li>Heat up at least 2 cup of water in the big steamer.  Let the water boil, then put the chicken in and steam for 45 min - 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Let it cool down until it can be handled by hand.  </li>
      <li>Tear meat off bones and arrange bone at the bottom, meat and skin on top.</li>
      <li>Alternatively, you can chop the chicken into pieces and arrange on a serving plate.</li>
      <li>Garnish with chopped green onion.</li>
    </ol>

    Note:

    <ol>
      <li>To test if the chicken is properly cooked, poke a chopstick into the thigh. It is done if and the juice comes out has no red color. </li>
      <li>You can substitute with chicken thigh or breast instead if prefer.</li>

  <summary>#4 - STIR FRIED BEFF HO FEN - 乾炒牛河</summary>

I learned how to make this dish from a professional chef-training course.  The myth is that it needs lots of oil to make this dish good. However, in fact, the key is to heat up the wok/frying pan hot before putting the oil.  In the restaurant, the beef is cooked by “run through” in a pot of oil (走油) before mixing with the noodle.  This is a very common technic for restaurant cooking.  However, I blanch the meat in water, which is less oily and easy to execute for home cooking.

<h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
<ul>
<li>375g Ho Fen河粉 (fresh thick rice noodle)</li>
<li>75g beef, sliced</li>
<li>Onion, yellow chive, bean sprout (</li>
</ul>

<h2>BEEF MARINADE:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1 TBSP oil</li>
<li>Pinch of each salt, baking soda, chicken powder (optional)</li>
<li>2 TBSP (or more) water</li>
</ul>

<h2>MAIN SEASONING:</h2>
<ul>
<li>1TBSP soy sauce</li>
<li>1TBSP dark soy sauce</li>
<li>1 tsp oyster sauce</li>
<li>¼ tsp salt</li>
<li>¼ tsp chicken powder (optional)</li>
<li>¼ tsp Maggie sauce</li>
</ul>


<ol>
<li>Mix beef with beef marinade and set aside.</li>
<li>Slice onion and cut yellow chive into 1 ½ inch long.</li>
<li>Boil a small pot of water; put the beef in, stir.</li>
<li>As soon as the beef is cooked (turn from red to brownish), drain and set aside.</li>
<li>Heat up the wok/large frying pan.  Add 2 TBSP oil to the wok after the wok is hot.</li>
<li>Put in the onion, and then add in Ho Fen and bean sprout.  Stir-fry until the Ho Fen is soft and the onion is translucent.</li>
<li>Add beef and seasoning. Mix well.  Then finally add the yellow chive.</li>
</ol>


Note:
<ol>
<li>A pinch is third of ¼ tsp, which is about ½ mil.  Therefore, it is just the slightest amount that you pinch between two fingers.</li>
<li>If you buy the fresh Ho Fen noodle, but not cook this dish the same day.  You should shake loose the noodle, before putting into the refrigerator. Otherwise, the noodle will stick together and hard to separate when hardens.</li>

  <summary>#6 - SMOKE FISH - 燻魚</summary>
  This is one of the signature Shanghainese dish.  I am not bragging, my Mom’s version is better than most of the restaurants.  Though the recipe is simple and the steps are easy, though the deep-frying is bit challenging for most people.  The key is to control the splatter.

  <h2>INGREDIENT:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Catty (600g) Carp 鯇魚</li>
    <li>1 TBSP Shao Xin wine</li>
    <li>4 TBSP Dark soy sauce</li>
    <li>3 TBSP Sugar</li>
    <li>1 Green onion</li>
    <li>Oil for frying</li>
  </ul>

  <ol>
    <li>Cut the carp in 3/4in. steak.  Rinse clean with cool water.</li>
    <li>Before frying, pat dry the fish thoroughly with paper towel or kitchen towel.</li>
    <li>Mix the Shao Xin wine, soy sauce, sugar in a mixing bowl. Break the green onion into 2 or 3 pieces and add into the bowl to form dipping sauce.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a deep frying pan until hot.</li>
    <li>Pat dry the fish one more time before put a few pieces of fish at a time into the frying oil. (Leave some space between the pieces, so they do not stick together).</li>
    <li>Cover the frying pan with a spatter guard, or a lid if needed to protect yourself from spatter.</li>
    <li>Let it fry for 1 min before flipping the fish. Fry both side of the fish until lightly brown.</li>
    <li>Remove the fish from the hot oil and dip it into the dipping sauce immediate.  Make sure the whole piece is well coated with the dipping sauce.</li>
    <li>Put the fish on a serving plate.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 5-9 until all the fish is done.</li>
    <li>Pour the remaining sauce over the fish and marinate for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
    <li>Serve at room temperature.</li>
  </ol>

  Note:

  <ol>
    <li>You know the oil is hot enough for frying when putting a chopstick or a small piece of bread, the oil starts steadily bubbling.</li>
    <li>Ways to reduce spatter during deep-frying are: very dry ingredient to reduce surface water; use a deep frying pan to contain spatter, use spatter guard or lid to prevent spatter to excape.</li>
  </ol>
