  <h1>#2 - STEAM MARINATED CHICKEN WITH PEPPERCORN - 花椒醃雞</h1>
  This is a spin-off of the more famous traditional dish Nanjing salted duck鹽水鴨. This recipe uses chicken, which is more readily available, and a simpler cooking method. Nonetheless, the finished product is just as delicious as its famous cousin.
