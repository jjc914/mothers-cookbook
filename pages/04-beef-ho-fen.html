  <h1>#4 - STIR FRIED BEEF HO FEN - 乾炒牛河</h1>
  I learned how to make this dish from a professional chef-training course. The myth is that it needs lots of oil to make this dish good. However, in fact, the key is to heat up the wok/frying pan hot before putting the oil. In the restaurant, the
  beef is cooked by “run through” in a pot of oil (走油) before mixing with the noodle. This is a very common technic for restaurant cooking. However, I blanch the meat in water, which is less oily and easy to execute for home cooking.
