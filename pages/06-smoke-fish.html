  <h1>#6 - SMOKE FISH - 燻魚</h1>
  This is one of the signature Shanghainese dish. I am not bragging, my Mom’s version is better than most of the restaurants. Though the recipe is simple and the steps are easy, though the deep-frying is bit challenging for most people. The key is
  to control the splatter.

  <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 Catty (600g) Carp 鯇魚</li>

    <li>Before frying, pat dry the fish thoroughly with paper towel or kitchen towel.</li>
    <li>Mix the Shao Xin wine, soy sauce, sugar in a mixing bowl. Break the green onion into 2 or 3 pieces and add into the bowl to form dipping sauce.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil in a deep frying pan until hot.</li>
    <li>Pat dry the fish one more time before put a few pieces of fish at a time into the frying oil. (Leave some space between the pieces, so they do not stick together).</li>
    <li>Cover the frying pan with a spatter guard, or a lid if needed to protect yourself from spatter.</li>
    <li>Let it fry for 1 min before flipping the fish. Fry both side of the fish until lightly brown.</li>
    <li>Remove the fish from the hot oil and dip it into the dipping sauce immediate. Make sure the whole piece is well coated with the dipping sauce.</li>
    <li>Put the fish on a serving plate.</li>

  <div class="note">
    Note:
    <ul>
      <li>You know the oil is hot enough for frying when putting a chopstick or a small piece of bread, the oil starts steadily bubbling.</li>
      <li>Ways to reduce spatter during deep-frying are: very dry ingredient to reduce surface water; use a deep frying pan to contain spatter, use spatter guard or lid to prevent spatter to excape.</li>
    </ul>
