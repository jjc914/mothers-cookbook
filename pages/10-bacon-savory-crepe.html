  <h1>#10 - SAVORY CREPE WITH BACON - 煙肉雞蛋攤餅</h1>
  This is a Chinese adaption of French food. Believe it or not, I used to eat it when I was a child in China. We did not have bacon or ham back, so we used crispy pork lard (the residue from making lard). It was delicious.

    <li>With one hand holding the handle of the frying pan, pout about ¼ cup of the batter into the frying pan. Turn the frying pan in circular motion while adding the batter. The goal here is to cover the frying pan with a thin layer of batter.

    <li>Cook for 1 min until the batter at the edge of the frying pan starts to curl.</li>
    <li>Using a spatula, carefully lift up the crepe from the edge. Move the spatula under the crepe until the whole crepe separates from the frying pan.</li>
