  <h1>#12 - BRAISED BEEF BISKET - 紅燒牛腩</h1>
  This is a very popular Cantonese dish. It is usually served on top of a bowl of soup noodle, or with some steaming white rice. A plate of sauté green vegetable is a perfect side dish for this meal. I like to cook this dish when I have time and
  keep it in the refrigerator for a quick meal in the next few days.

    Note:
    <ul>
      <li>It is easiest to cook this dish in a crock-pot if you have one. But if you don’t’ have, it is OK too. Just cook it in a big pot with more water to cover the meat. Bring to boil, and then simmer for 1-2 hours. Check the water level and the
        doneness of the meat every 30 min. The rest of the procedures are the same.</li>
