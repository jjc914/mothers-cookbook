  <h1>#15 - FIVE SPICED BEEF SHANK - 五香牛蹍</h1>
  This is another signature Shanghainese dish. My Mom made it well and was always loved by her guests. This is commonly served as one of the old appetizers before the main dishes.

  <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 whole beef shank (1 ½ - 2 lb) </li>
    <li>1 tsp peppercorn</li>
    <li>2 star anise</li>
    <li>1 cinnamon stick</li>
    <li>3 TBST dark soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 TBSP Shao Xing wine</li>
    <li>1tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 inch3 rock sugar</li>
    <li>2 slices ginger</li>
    <li>1 green onion</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Rinse the beef shank in cold water.</li>
    <li>Bring a pot of water to boil and blanch the beef shank for 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Rinse it in running water to remove the scum.</li>
    <li>Put the beef, and all the rest of the ingredients in a crook pot.</li>
    <li>Add water into the crock-pot to cover the meat.</li>
    <li>Bring to boil (it may take 1 hour). Let it cook until meat is tender. (Depending on the crock-pot, it may take 4 hours or more. At least you don’t have to keep an eye on it.)</li>
    <li>The meat is done when it feels soft when poke with a chopstick.</li>
    <li>Take the meat out and put it in a plastic box with a lid.</li>
    <li>Let it cool to room temperature, and then into the refrigerator for overnight.</li>
    <li>Put the sauce into a big jar and then into a refrigerator to let the fat solidify.</li>
    <li>Before serving, take out the sauce. Remove the fat from the top (it should be a layer of white solid on top of the brown sauce).</li>
    <li>Put the sauce in a saucepan to condense to ½ cup.</li>
    <li>Slice the beef out from the refrigerator, and slice it into thin slices.</li>
    <li>Put some condensed sauce on top. Serve cold.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="right">(Serves 1 person)</p>
  <div class="note">
    Note:
    <ul>
      <li>The leftover stays well in the refrigerator for a few days. It is nice to serve it with a bowl of soup noodle with some green vegetables on the side.</li>
      <li>Another serving suggestion is to put it inside the steam bread (see steam bread recipe).</li>
    </ul>
