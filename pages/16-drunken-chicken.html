  <h1>#16 - DRUNKEN CHICKEN花 - 雕醉雞</h1>
  This is an authentic Shanghainese dish as well as my mother’s signature dish. It is a must for her dinner parties and the guests loved it. It is better to use Huadiao 花雕 (the aged and better quality of Shaoxing wine) 紹興酒. This will give the
  chicken a strong wine fragrant and mellow taste. This dish is served as one of the many appetizers for a Shanghainese banquet and can prepared 1-2 days ahead of the time.

    Note:
    <ul>
      <li>To test if the chicken is properly cooked, poke a chopstick into the thigh. It is done if and the juice comes out has no red color.</li>
      <li>If you can substitute whole chicken with 2 pounds of chicken wings or other cuts of chicken. Steaming time for chicken wings will be 20 minutes.</li>
