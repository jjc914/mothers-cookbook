  <h1>#20 - STEAM BREAD - 發麵夾餅</h1>
  This is a Cantonese version of steam bread. It uses both yeast and baking powder. I find this way of making steam bread not only it is easy and time efficient, but also yields more consistent result than the yeast alone version. This bread is a
  good accompany with honey-glazed ham蜜汁火腿 and braised pork belly 紅燒肉.

  <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>160g cake (low gluten) flour</li>
    <li>90g lukewarm water</li>
    <li>12g sugar</li>
    <li>½ tsp (2g) yeast</li>
    <li>1tsp (4g) baking powder</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Mix yeast, water, and let stand for 1 minute. You will see the yeast foaming up. That means that the yeast is alive and active.</li>
    <li>Mix cake flour, sugar and baking flour. Pour the yeast and water mixture into the dry ingredient.</li>
    <li>Mix well, and then knead by hand until the dough is smooth and a bit shiny on the outside.</li>
    <li>Test to see if the dough is ready by cutting it with a knife. The dough is ready if the cut surface is smooth.</li>
    <li>Roll the dough into a long tube, and cut it into 12 equal portions.</li>
    <li>Turn the cut surface facing up, and press down each piece to form a circular shape.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle some flour onto each piece and onto the counter top.</li>
    <li>Use rolling pin to roll the dough out to a long oval shape about 2” x 4” x ¼ inch thick.</li>
    <li>Brush some vegetable oil on the surface and fold it in half. Place it on a pre-cut 2”x2” wax paper.</li>
    <li>Repeat step 8 & 9 for all pieces. Place finished bread in a steamer, put the steamer in a warm place away from draft (eg. inside an oven), and let it rise for 30-40 minutes.</li>
    <li>Heat water in a wok until boiling and place the steamer on top and steam for 10 minutes.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="note">
    Note:
    <ul>
      <li>Makes 12 steam bread approximately 2”x2” in size.</li>
      <li>For best result, use cake flour, but you may substitute with all-purpose flour as wish.</li>
      <li>Knead by pushing the dough out away from your body with a long stroke. Then fold the dough in and repeat.</li>
      <li>Step 10, 11 – you may put the finished bread on a cookie sheet lined with wax paper, and then cover it with kitchen towel to let it rise. Move the bread into a steamer when ready to cook.</li>
