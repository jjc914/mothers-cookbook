  <h1>#21 - SWEET AND SOUR SPARE RIBS 1 - 糖醋排骨</h1>
  This is one of most famous Shanghainese dish. My Mom cooked it very often at her dinner parties. I loved to be my mother’s sous chef when she prepared for the events. We spent hours planning and discussing the menu, and afterwards reflecting on
  how the dishes turned out.

  <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>600 g spare ribs</li>
    <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
    <li>3 TBSP dark soy sauce</li>
    <li>2 Star anise</li>
    <li>2 slices ginger</li>
    <li>1 Green onion</li>
    <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
    <li>3 TBSP Zhenjiang vinegar鎮江醋</li>
    <li>50 g rock sugar</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Tie the green onion in a knot like a string.</li>
    <li>Wash spare ribs and cut between the bones.</li>
    <li>Dry the ribs with paper towel or kitchen towel. Let it air dry a bit more before frying.</li>
    <li>In a saucepan, fill at least 2 inches of vegetable oil. Heat up the oil.</li>
    <li>When the oil is hot, put a few pieces of spare ribs into the oil. Cover with a splatter guard immediately to prevent hot oil from splashing out.</li>
    <li>Use a pair of long chopsticks to stir gently to spread the ribs evenly in the oil.</li>
    <li>Fry until the outside of the ribs is slightly brown. Remove with a strainer.</li>
    <li>Repeat steps 5 & 6 until all spare ribs are done.</li>
    <li>Put all the ribs into another pot. Put in the soy sauce, star anise, ginger, green onion, and water to about ½ inch above the spare ribs.</li>
    <li>Bring to boil, and then let it simmer for 1 hour. Until the meat is tender, but not too tender that it falls off the bone.</li>
    <li>Add vinegar and rock sugar; continue to cook to dissolve the sugar and for vinegar to incorporate into the meat. Cook for about 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Continue to stir and condense until the sauce almost evaporated, and there is a coat of dark shinning sauce on the ribs.</li>
    <li>Serve when it is warm, or at room temperature.</li>
  </ol>
  <p class="right">(Serves 1 person)</p>
  <div class="note">
    Note:
    <ul>
      <li>Cut the spare rib into smaller pieces by cutting the meat between the bones. Try to cut at the middle, so the bone will stay one during cooking.</li>
      <li>Typically, I buy rack of spare ribs with bones cut to 1 ½ to 2 inches. This is the size restaurants use. However, if you cannot get it, it is ok to use whatever size you can get.</li>
      <li>After completing step 11, you may want to remove the excessive fat on top of the sauce. Pour the sauce into a jar and let it solidify in the refrigerator. Before serving, remove the solid fat from the top, return the sauce and ribs in a
        pot, and resume step 12.</li>
      <li>This is the elegant version of the dish. It involves a bit more steps and requires more time and attention. For everyday home meal, I cook a simplified version. See recipe Sweet & Sour Spare Rib2.</li>
    </ul>
