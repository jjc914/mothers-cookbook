  This dish goes well by itself, but particularly well with soup noodle or stir-fried Shanghainese rice stick. It is also a proper dish in Shanghainese restaurants.

    <li>100 g Salted preserved vegetable (雪裡紅)</li>
    <li>150g Pork slices</li>
    <li>100g can / fresh Bamboo shoot</li>
    <li>½ Red bell pepper</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>1 TBSP Cooking wine</li>

  <h2>Marinade:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 slices ginger</li>
    <li>½ tsp salt</li>
    <li>pepper to taste</li>
    <li>1 tsp cornstarch / potato starch</li>
    <li>3 TBSP water</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut the salted preserved vegetable (雪裡紅) into small pieces. Cut the leave in both directions, so it is not stringy.</li>
    <li>Soak the vegetable in a bowl of water for at least 4 hours. Change water a few times to wash out the saltiness.</li>
    <li>Squeeze dry the salted vegetable and put 1 tsp of sugar to marinate.</li>
    <li>Slice bamboo shoot into thin julienne along the fiber, and then boil it in some salt water to remove the canned taste.</li>
    <li>Slice pork into fine julienne then put in the marinade ingredients. Mix well and let sit for ½ hour.</li>
    <li>Slice the red bell pepper into the same julienne size.</li>
    <li>In a wok or frying pan, add 2 TBSP vegetable oil.</li>
    <li>When oil is hot, add the preserved vegetable. Stir-fry for a few minutes in low heat. Make sure it does not burn.</li>
    <li>Add the bamboo shoot then a few TBSP water. Cook for another 1 – 2 minutes. Remove and set aside.</li>
    <li>Clean the wok or frying pan then put on the heat again. When hot, add some vegetable oil.</li>
    <li>Put the pork in and stir-fry for a bit. Add the Shao Xing wine.</li>
    <li>When the pork is fully cooked, add the preserved vegetable, mix well. Just before serving, add the red bell pepper.</li>
  </ol>

  <div class="note">
    Note:
    <ul>
      <li>Easier way to slice pork: Put the fresh pork in the freezer a day before using it. Remove from freezer and slightly defrost it (1 hour) for easy slicing. The pork should be solid, but easy for the knife to slice through.</li>
      <li>You may prepare this dish early or when free, and add it to soup noodle, fried noodle or fried rice cake when you need.</li>
      <li>Chicken maybe used instead of pork.</li>
    </ul>
