  <h1>#29 - WHEAT GLUTEN (KAOFU) WITH BLACK FUNGUS - 美味烤麩</h1>
  This is a typical Shanghainese cold appetizer dish. Though it may seems difficult to make because there are many steps for preparation, but the cooking is very simple. Kaofu is the wheat gluten extracted from flour. It is high in protein,
