  <h1>#30 - PAN-FRIED PORK BUN - 生煎包</h1>
  This is a very popular Shanghainese dim sum. The Chinese name生煎包, which literally translated to “raw pan-fried bun”. You are supposed to pan-fry the raw buns to golden crispy on bottom, soft on the top and juicy inside. Unfortunately, most
  restaurants pre-steam the buns before gently brown the bottom before serving which yields an inferior dish.

  <h2>Directions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Put the yeast into the warm water. Let it sit for 5 minutes to activate.</li>
    <li>Put all the ingredients in stuffing into a bowl; add in all the seasoning (except the water, oil and sesame oil).</li>
    <li>Using chopsticks, stir the minced meat vigorously in circular motion until it becomes sticky pasty consistence.</li>
    <li>Add in 1 TBSP of water into the meat, stir vigorously again in circular motion until it becomes sticky pasty consistence.</li>
    <li>Repeat step 4 until all the water is incorporated into the meat.</li>
    <li>Add in the vegetable oil; mix gently, then the sesame oil. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Mix cake flour, sugar and baking flour in a bowl. Pour in the yeast and water mixture.</li>
    <li>Mix well, and then knead by hand until the dough is smooth and a bit shiny on the outside(about 3-5min).</li>
    <li>Test to see if the dough is ready by cutting it with a knife. The dough is ready if the cut surface is smooth.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into 12 equal portions (approx. 20g each).</li>
    <li>Press each piece flat. Use a rolling pin, roll the dough out into a 3 ½ - 4 inch circle.</li>
    <li>Roughly, divide the meat stuffing into 12 equal portions by drawing lines in it.</li>
    <li>Put one portion of the meat onto a rolled-out dough. While turning the dough, squeeze it close, leaving no opening on the top. Repeat for the rest of the dough.</li>
    <li>Put the finished bun on a floured baking sheet and cover with a towel. Put the baking sheet in a warm place for 30-40 min to let it rise.</li>
    <li>Heat a frying pan (preferably cast iron) with ¾ cup water and 1 TBSP oil. When the water boils, line the buns in a single layer on the frying pan without touching each other.</li>
    <li>Cover the lid and let it cook for 7-8 minutes.</li>
    <li>Uncover the lid and let the excessive water evaporate.</li>
    <li>Add another 2 TBSP oil between the buns.</li>
    <li>It is done when all the water is evaporated and the bottom of the bun is golden brown.</li>
    <li>Put the buns onto a serving plate. Garnish with toasted sesame seed and chopped green onion.</li>
