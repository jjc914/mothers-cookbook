  <div class="note">
    Note:
    <ul>
      <li>If you cannot wheat starch, you may swap it out by equal amount of glutinous rice flour. The finished product will be a bit stickier and chewier.</li>
      <li>Slab sugar is raw cane sugar in the shape of rectangular slab. You may use other kinds of raw cane sugar if you cannot find slab sugar.</li>
      <li>It is important to let the sugar water to cool down before mixing with the flour, so it will not cook the flour and make it very hard to stir and lumpy.</li>
      <li>After step 11, the rice cake is ready to eat. However, it is very gluey and sticky, and different to cut. I prefer to serve it after it hardens and re-fried.</li>
    </ul>
