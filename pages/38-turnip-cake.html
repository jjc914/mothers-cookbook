  <h1>#38 - TURNIP CAKE - 蘿蔔糕</h1>
  My family lived with my grandmother and aunt when we came to Hong Kong from China. Every Chinese New Year, my aunt will make this traditional Cantonese New Year’s food. This recipe is derived from the way my aunt made it with some modification.

  <ol>
    <li>Wash and peel the turnip with a fruit peeler. Coarsely shred the turnip with a food grater into a big pot.</li>
    <li>Soak the mushroom in cold water for 4 hours and dry shrimp for 2 hours. </li>
    <li>Cut the Chinese sausage, Chinese smoked pork, mushroom, and dry shrimp into similar small sizes.</li>
    <li>Cut the green onion and the stem of the cilantro into small pieces.</li>
    <li>Put the rice flour and corn starch in a big bowl and stir in 2 ½ cup water. Stir to mix well. The mixture should be a very thick liquid consistency.</li>
    <li>Heat the oil or duck lard. Sauté with the meat, mushroom, dry shrimp, chopped green onion and cilantro in low heat until nice aroma comes out.</li>
    <li>Heat the shredded turnip in the big pot until it boils.</li>
    <li>Using a ladle, scoop some hot turnip into the flour-water mixture, stirring it at the same time.</li>
    <li>Continue to add hot turnip into the flour-water mixture, ladle by ladle at first, then bigger quantity later until all turnip has been added.</li>
    <li>Add in the sautéed meat (saving a bit for garnish later) and mix well.</li>
    <li>Add salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    <li>Pour the mixture into one 4-litre container (or several containers) up to 2-inch deep.</li>
    <li>Garnish the top with some remaining sauteed meat.</li>
    <li>Put it in a steamer with boiling water and steam for 1.5 hour for 1 large container, 1 hour for several smaller containers.</li>
    <li>Let cool completely on the counter and in refrigerator.</li>
    <li>Slice the turnip into 2 x 2 x ½ inch slices and pan fry in oil before serve.</li>
  </ol>

    Note:
    <ul>
      <li>To make the smoke duck lard: use 75g smoke duck fat trimmed from the skin and fat part of the duck. Cut into smaller pieces and put it in a small saucepan. Heat in flow flame to extract the oil from the solid fat. It is done when the fat
        solid becomes lightly brown and crisp. The oil extracted should be clear.</li>
    </ul>
