    <summary>#4 - STIR FRIED BEFF HO FEN - 乾炒牛河</summary>
    I learned how to make this dish from a professional chef-training course. The myth is that it needs lots of oil to make this dish good. However, in fact, the key is to heat up the wok/frying pan hot before putting the oil. In the restaurant, the
    beef is cooked by “run through” in a pot of oil (走油) before mixing with the noodle. This is a very common technic for restaurant cooking. However, I blanch the meat in water, which is less oily and easy to execute for home cooking.
    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>375g Ho Fen河粉 (fresh thick rice noodle)</li>
      <li>75g beef, sliced</li>
      <li>Onion, yellow chive, bean sprout (</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>BEEF MARINADE:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 TBSP oil</li>
      <li>Pinch of each salt, baking soda, chicken powder (optional)</li>
      <li>2 TBSP (or more) water</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>MAIN SEASONING:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1TBSP soy sauce</li>
      <li>1TBSP dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp oyster sauce</li>
      <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
      <li>¼ tsp chicken powder (optional)</li>
      <li>¼ tsp Maggie sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Mix beef with beef marinade and set aside.</li>
      <li>Slice onion and cut yellow chive into 1 ½ inch long.</li>
      <li>Boil a small pot of water; put the beef in, stir.</li>
      <li>As soon as the beef is cooked (turn from red to brownish), drain and set aside.</li>
      <li>Heat up the wok/large frying pan. Add 2 TBSP oil to the wok after the wok is hot.</li>
      <li>Put in the onion, and then add in Ho Fen and bean sprout. Stir-fry until the Ho Fen is soft and the onion is translucent.</li>
      <li>Add beef and seasoning. Mix well. Then finally add the yellow chive.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Note:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>A pinch is third of ¼ tsp, which is about ½ mil. Therefore, it is just the slightest amount that you pinch between two fingers.</li>
      <li>If you buy the fresh Ho Fen noodle, but not cook this dish the same day. You should shake loose the noodle, before putting into the refrigerator. Otherwise, the noodle will stick together and hard to separate when hardens.</li>

    <summary>#6 - SMOKE FISH - 燻魚</summary>
    This is one of the signature Shanghainese dish. I am not bragging, my Mom’s version is better than most of the restaurants. Though the recipe is simple and the steps are easy, though the deep-frying is bit challenging for most people. The key is
    to control the splatter.
    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 Catty (600g) Carp 鯇魚</li>
      <li>1 TBSP Shao Xin wine</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Cut the carp in 3/4in. steak. Rinse clean with cool water.</li>
      <li>Before frying, pat dry the fish thoroughly with paper towel or kitchen towel.</li>
      <li>Mix the Shao Xin wine, soy sauce, sugar in a mixing bowl. Break the green onion into 2 or 3 pieces and add into the bowl to form dipping sauce.</li>
      <li>Heat the oil in a deep frying pan until hot.</li>
      <li>Pat dry the fish one more time before put a few pieces of fish at a time into the frying oil. (Leave some space between the pieces, so they do not stick together).</li>
      <li>Cover the frying pan with a spatter guard, or a lid if needed to protect yourself from spatter.</li>
      <li>Let it fry for 1 min before flipping the fish. Fry both side of the fish until lightly brown.</li>
      <li>Remove the fish from the hot oil and dip it into the dipping sauce immediate. Make sure the whole piece is well coated with the dipping sauce.</li>
      <li>Put the fish on a serving plate.</li>
      <li>Repeat steps 5-9 until all the fish is done.</li>
      <li>Pour the remaining sauce over the fish and marinate for at least 2 hours before serving.</li>
      <li>Serve at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Note:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>You know the oil is hot enough for frying when putting a chopstick or a small piece of bread, the oil starts steadily bubbling.</li>
      <li>Ways to reduce spatter during deep-frying are: very dry ingredient to reduce surface water; use a deep frying pan to contain spatter, use spatter guard or lid to prevent spatter to excape.</li>

    This is a Chinese adaption of French food. Believe it or not, I used to eat it when I was a child in China. We did not have bacon or ham back, so we used crispy pork lard (the residue from making lard). It was delicious.
    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cup Flour</li>
      <li>2 eggs</li>

      <li>Heat an 8 to 10-inch flat non-stick frying pan. Brush oil to cover the whole frying pan.</li>
      <li>With one hand holding the handle of the frying pan, pout about ¼ cup of the batter into the frying pan. Turn the frying pan in circular motion while adding the batter. The goal here is to cover the frying pan with a thin layer of batter.
        Add a bit more batter at the area not covered by the batter.</li>
      <li>Cook for 1 min until the batter at the edge of the frying pan starts to curl.</li>
      <li>Using a spatula, carefully lift up the crepe from the edge. Move the spatula under the crepe until the whole crepe separates from the frying pan.</li>
      <li>Lift up the crepe and flip it. </li>
      <li>Cook for another 30 sec until the underside has small brown spots.</li>
      <li>Remove the crepe and stack them on a flat plate.</li>

    <summary>#12 - BRAISED BEEF BISKET - 紅燒牛腩</summary>
    This is a very popular Cantonese dish. It is usually served on top of a bowl of soup noodle, or with some steaming white rice. A plate of sauté green vegetable is a perfect side dish for this meal. I like to cook this dish when I have time and
    keep it in the refrigerator for a quick meal in the next few days.
    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>600g（1斤）beef brisket牛腩</li>
      <li>600g beef tendon牛筋 (optional)</li>
      <li>1pc（1 cubic inch) ginger</li>
      <li>2 TBSP dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 1/2 star anise</li>
      <li>1 pc cinnamon stick (桂皮）</li>
      <li>1 Chinese white turnip (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut meat into 1.5-inch cube. Cut the beef tendon a bit bigger.</li>
      <li>Peel the skin of the turnip with a peeler and cut it into chunks about the size of the meat. Set aside for later.</li>
      <li>Bring a pot of water to boil and blanch the meat and tendon for 2 miniutes.</li>
      <li>Rinse in running water to remove scum.</li>
      <li>Put all ingredients into a crock-pot.</li>
      <li>Add water into the crock-pot to cover the meat. </li>
      <li>Bring to boil (it may take 1 hour). Let it cook until meat is tender (depending of the crock-pot, it may take a few hours. At least you don’t have to watch it)</li>
      <li>Remove the tendon from the pot when it is soft. Continue to cook the brisket until soft.</li>
      <li>Remove the cooked brisket from the pot. </li>
      <li>Transfer the liquid into a saucepan and condense the sauce to about a cup. </li>
      <li>Add the cut urnip into the sauce at this point and cook until tender (translucent). </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Note:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>It is easiest to cook this dish in a crock-pot if you have one. But if you don’t’ have, it is OK too. Just cook it in a big pot with more water to cover the meat. Bring to boil, and then simmer for 1-2 hours. Check the water level and the
        doneness of the meat every 30 min. The rest of the procedures are the same.</li>

    This is one of most famous Shanghainese dish. My Mom cooked it very often at her dinner parties. I loved to be my mother’s sous chef when she prepared for the events. We spent hours planning and discussing the menu, and afterwards reflecting on
    how the dishes turned out.
    <h2>INGREDIENTS:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>600 g spare ribs</li>
      <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
      <li>3 TBSP dark soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 Star anise</li>
      <li>2 slices ginger</li>
      <li>1 Green onion</li>
      <li>¼ tsp salt</li>
      <li>3 TBSP Zhenjiang vinegar鎮江醋</li>
      <li>50 g rock sugar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Tie the green onion in a knot like a string.</li>
      <li>Wash spare ribs and cut between the bones.</li>
      <li>Dry the ribs with paper towel or kitchen towel. Let it air dry a bit more before frying.</li>
      <li>In a saucepan, fill at least 2 inches of vegetable oil. Heat up the oil.</li>
      <li>When the oil is hot, put a few pieces of spare ribs into the oil. Cover with a splatter guard immediately to prevent hot oil from splashing out.</li>
      <li>Use a pair of long chopsticks to stir gently to spread the ribs evenly in the oil.</li>
      <li>Fry until the outside of the ribs is slightly brown. Remove with a strainer.</li>
      <li>Repeat steps 5 & 6 until all spare ribs are done.</li>
      <li>Put all the ribs into another pot. Put in the soy sauce, star anise, ginger, green onion, and water to about ½ inch above the spare ribs.</li>
      <li>Bring to boil, and then let it simmer for 1 hour. Until the meat is tender, but not too tender that it falls off the bone.</li>
      <li>Add vinegar and rock sugar; continue to cook to dissolve the sugar and for vinegar to incorporate into the meat. Cook for about 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>Continue to stir and condense until the sauce almost evaporated, and there is a coat of dark shinning sauce on the ribs.</li>
      <li>Serve when it is warm, or at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Note:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut the spare rib into smaller pieces by cutting the meat between the bones. Try to cut at the middle, so the bone will stay one during cooking.</li>
      <li>Typically, I buy rack of spare ribs with bones cut to 1 ½ to 2 inches. This is the size restaurants use. However, if you cannot get it, it is ok to use whatever size you can get.</li>
      <li>After completing step 11, you may want to remove the excessive fat on top of the sauce. Pour the sauce into a jar and let it solidify in the refrigerator. Before serving, remove the solid fat from the top, return the sauce and ribs in a
        pot, and resume step 12.</li>
      <li>This is the elegant version of the dish. It involves a bit more steps and requires more time and attention. For everyday home meal, I cook a simplified version. See recipe Sweet & Sour Spare Rib2.</li>

      <li>Pour the sugar water into the flour mixture slowly, stirring with a wooden spatula continually, trying to break up the lumps.</li>
      <li>Mix in vegetable oil.</li>
      <li>Pass the mixture through a sieve to make sure that there is no lumps in it.</li>
      <li>Oil an approx. 1200 ml circular container.</li>
      <li>Pour the mixture into a circular container, gently knock the container on the counter to make remove air bubbles and smooth out top surface.</li>
      <li>Garnish with a pitted red date.</li>

      <li>When the water boils, put in the rice cake mixture and steam for 1 ½ hour in low heat.</li>

    </ol>
    <h2>Note:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>If you cannot wheat starch, you may swap it out by equal amount of glutinous rice flour. The finished product will be a bit stickier and chewier.</li>
      <li>Slab sugar is raw cane sugar in the shape of rectangular slab. You may use other kinds of raw cane sugar if you cannot find slab sugar.</li>
      <li>It is important to let the sugar water to cool down before mixing with the flour, so it will not cook the flour and make it very hard to stir and lumpy.</li>
      <li>After step 11, the rice cake is ready to eat. However, it is very gluey and sticky, and different to cut. I prefer to serve it after it hardens and re-fried.</li>
